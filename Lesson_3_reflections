When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're not always working on the same workstation or when you're working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To be sure you want the data that is on the remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: a copy of a repository on GitHub

Clone: a copy of a repository

Branch: a string of commits 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Being able to detect if there are new commits online

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
